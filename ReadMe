Some of the data input files had strange text encodings that has to be corrected one way or another:

    FOOD_DES.txt: text/plain; charset=unknown-8bit  - odd \22x characrters, just removed
    FOOTNOTE.txt: text/plain; charset=unknown-8bit  - don't care, current;y unused
    NUTR_DEF.txt: text/plain; charset=iso-8859-1    - converted to utf-8 before ingest
    WEIGHT.txt:   text/plain; charset=iso-8859-1    - one french-style entree, renamed

e.g.  iconv -f ISO-8859-2 -t UTF8 NUTR_DEF.txt

TODO: see data/grocery-list for a list of the 500 or so foods
I've bought in the last few years. I want to get a CSV of these data
to create a web app to streamline calorie use.
